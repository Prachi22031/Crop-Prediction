# Crop-Prediction

This project focuses on predictive crop prediction using various machine learning algorithms. 
The key components include:
Separating Features and Target Label: Dividing the dataset into input features and the target variable.
Machine Learning Models:
1. Decision Tree
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Logistic Regression
5. Random Forest
6. XGBoost
Applying the trained models to predict outcomes based on new, manually input data.
This combination of methods allows for robust and accurate crop predictions.
